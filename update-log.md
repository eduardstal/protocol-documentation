We updated our sdk to v 0.6 which means some changes should be made to use it. Here are commits that you may follow:

Some of you may know, some may not. Rarible Ethereum SDK is usable with web3.js or ethers.js now.

ethers.js support was just improved. Currently, PR submitted, will add tests for ethers.js support and will be published next week. (We will update readme on GitHub SDK page to make it obvious for devs)

Also, we're working on building SDK for usage inside browser (Actually, if you have experience in this and would like to help us, it's appreciated very much).

If you have any suggestion on SDK or can't use now, pls, contact me directly (Eugene Nacu | Rarible#9332 - Discord), we'll sort this out. Because, using the protocol can be difficult + we will constantly add new features (for example, soon new types of orders will be supported, so to buy an NFT you'll need to know all this). Supporting all new features will be tough (if you implement it by yourselves, not via SDK).
